          Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла,[2]
          pronounced [nǐkola têsla];[a] 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7 January
          1943) was a Serbian-American[5][6][7] inventor, electrical engineer,
          mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to
          the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply
          system.

         <strong>Tesla's</strong>  long-abandoned Long Island laboratory will soon become a museum.
          Earlier this year, a non-profit organization raised enough money to
          purchase the long-abandoned <strong> Wardenclyffe</strong>. The group plans to restore
          the building and turn it into a <strong>Tesla museum</strong> and science education
          center.

        <strong>Tesla</strong> was not a savvy businessman and suffered financially, despite his achievements. He lost financial backing from <strong>Morgan</strong>, who felt he couldn’t profit from Tesla’s wireless electricity concept, and sold his assets to make up for dual foreclosures on Wardenclyffe. The property was later sold to a film processing company. In 1917, the <strong>U.S. government</strong> demolished Tesla’s partially completed tower because it worried<strong>German</strong>  spies would use it to intercept communications during World War I.

        <li>In 1901, <strong>Tesla</strong>  received financial backing from<strong>J. Pierpont Morgan</strong>  to build his Wardenclyffe laboratory in Shoreham, Long Island. The facility included the “Tesla Tower,” a 185-foot high structure with a 65-foot copper dome transmitter on the top. Tesla’s vision was to use the tower to transmit signals and free, unlimited wireless electricity all over the world. Thanks to Tesla's early work, wireless transfer of energy is finally being realized today -- from wireless chargers for electric toothbrushes and smartphones, to wireless electric vehicle charging, a technology being researched at the Energy Department’s National Labs.</li>
        <li><strong>“Teslas,”</strong> a unit used to measure the strength of magnetic fields, are named after Tesla. Another namesake is <strong>Tesla Motors</strong>, the electric car start-up, in homage to Tesla’s role in the invention of the electric motor.</li>
